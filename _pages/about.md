[cite_start]I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering in Systems and Biomedical Engineering** at **Cairo University** (2021-2026)[cite: 4, 6]. [cite_start]I currently hold a **CGPA of 3.8/4.0** and am **ranked 6th** in my class[cite: 4].

My research and professional experience focus on Artificial Intelligence, Agentic Systems, and Medical Imaging. [cite_start]I recently completed an internship as an **AI Intern at IBM**, where I worked on large-scale projects and developed a multi-agent system using MCPs and AutoGen[cite: 8, 10]. [cite_start]Additionally, I served as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant at Nile University**, working on the early detection and diagnosis of papilledema using AI and fundus imaging[cite: 11, 13].

My work has been recognized in the academic community. [cite_start]My project, "Real-Time Student Drowsiness Detection Using CNN Spatial Transformer," was published in the **7th NILES Conference** and secured **1st place** at both the **IEEE Egyptian Students Paper Contest** and the **NU Egypt Undergraduate Research Forum**[cite: 19, 21, 41].

### Key Projects
* [cite_start]**CUBE.AI:** An ongoing agentic platform for clinical AI model development that integrates MONAI Label, nnU-Net, SAM, and Vista3D for an end-to-end PACS-to-deployment workflow[cite: 15, 17].
* [cite_start]**Trans Quake:** Developed a Transformer-based architecture to classify extraterrestrial seismic events from NASA's Apollo mission data with 0.88 accuracy[cite: 24, 27].
* [cite_start]**Cognitive Control Analysis:** Performed group-level fMRI analysis on Flanker Task data using FSL and GLM to identify activation in the prefrontal cortex[cite: 22, 23].

[cite_start]Beyond research, I served as the **Technical Director for IEEE EMBS**, where I led five technical clubs (AI, Embedded Systems, SWE, Medical Equipment, Research) and organized workshops for over 500 students[cite: 43].
