I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering in Systems and Biomedical Engineering** at **Cairo University** (2021-2026). I currently hold a **CGPA of 3.8/4.0** and am **ranked 6th** in my class.

My research and professional experience focus on Artificial Intelligence, Computer vision, Agentic Systems, and Medical Imaging. I recently completed an internship as an **AI Intern at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com)**, where I worked on large-scale projects and developed a multi-agent system using MCPs and AutoGen
<!-- . Additionally, I served as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant at Nile University**, working on the early detection and diagnosis of papilledema using AI and fundus imaging. -->

[cite_start]I have also contributed to the field of computer vision with a publication in the **NILES conference** and have been honored with **multiple awards in research competitions**

<!-- ### Key Projects
* **CUBE.AI:** An ongoing agentic platform for clinical AI model development that integrates MONAI Label, nnU-Net, SAM, and Vista3D for an end-to-end PACS-to-deployment workflow.
* **Trans Quake:** Developed a Transformer-based architecture to classify extraterrestrial seismic events from NASA's Apollo mission data with 0.88 accuracy.
* **Cognitive Control Analysis:** Performed group-level fMRI analysis on Flanker Task data using FSL and GLM to identify activation in the prefrontal cortex. -->

Beyond research, I served as the **Technical Director for IEEE EMBS**, where I led five technical clubs (AI, Embedded Systems, SWE, Medical Equipment, Research) and organized workshops for over 500 students[cite: 43].
